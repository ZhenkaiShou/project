# Simple Implementation of Recurrent Neural Network
## Basics
This repository implements a simple recurrent neural network (RNN) to do the classification on MNIST dataset. RNN reads the input image line by line, and outputs the label of the image when the last input sequence (the last row of the image) is fed into RNN.
