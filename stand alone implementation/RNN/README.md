# Simple Implementation of Recurrent Neural Network
## Basics
This repository implements a simple recurrent neural network (RNN) to do the classification on MNIST dataset. RNN reads the input image (28 \* 28) line by line and outputs the class of the image when the last input sequence (the last row of the image) is fed into RNN.
